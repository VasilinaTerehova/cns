Community Notification System
=============================

TODO list ( ordered by priority)
---------


- first access to Tools > Notifications with 0 (zero) notifications stored: "Error processing component"
- pass the notifications dashboard through UX
- add a persistent mechanism for subscribe/{notificationType} and unsubscribe/{notificationType}
- validate incoming notifications against list of subscribed notificationTypes
- eventStorage.ktr must include a step that does a UrlDecoder.decode for each of the received params (either that or within cpk itself)
- provide the means for a user to subscribe / unsubscribe ( perhaps an option within the notifications dashboard itself )
- when we move to another page or filter the notifications using the search box, the table header checkbox must update
- change notifications dashboard title to "Community Notifications System" (on browser tabs)
- e.srcElement used on Table Component doesn't work in Firefox. Alternatives: use e.target (only works for IE9+) or use jQuery equivalent - $(this)
