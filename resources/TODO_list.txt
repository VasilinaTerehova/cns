Community Notification System
=============================

TODO list ( by priority)
---------

1 - add a persistent mechanism for subscribe/{notificationType} and unsubscribe/{notificationType}
2 - validate incoming notifications against list of subscribed notificationTypes
3 - eventStorage.ktr must include a step that does a UrlDecoder.decode for each of the received params (either that or within cpk itself)
4 - provide the means for a user to subscribe / unsubscribe ( perhaps an option within the notifications dashboard itself )
5 - pass the notifications dashboard through UX
