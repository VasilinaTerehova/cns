Community Notification System
=============================

TODO list ( by priority)
---------

1 - eventConsumer.ktr *must* always relate to a user (read: must receive a param 'user' and do a query for that user's notifications *only*)
2 - eventStorage.ktr must include a step that does a UrlDecoder.decode for each of the received params (either that or within cpk itself)
3 - update database ddl to include 2 new colums: 'unread' (flag) and 'entryDate'
4 - in the sparkl dashboard, implement the 'mark as read/unread' , the 'delete notification' and the 'count total/unread'
5 - remove hardcoded css styling from within cns.js and place it in a css file next to it
6 - change ktr names from "eventConsumer" and "eventStorage" to "read" and "store" ( and update all places where this will impact )
6 - sparkl dashboard: provide some column sorting capabilities
6 - sparkl dashboard: provide some filtering capabilities ( unread only , to: USER/ROLE/ALL , from: sender X/Y/Z, from-to Date, ... )
