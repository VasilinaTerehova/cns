- first access to Tools > Notifications with 0 (zero) notifications stored: "Error processing component"
- pass the notifications dashboard through UX
- add a persistent mechanism for subscribe/{notificationType} and unsubscribe/{notificationType}
- validate incoming notifications against list of subscribed notificationTypes
- eventStorage.ktr must include a step that does a UrlDecoder.decode for each of the received params (either that or within cpk itself)
- provide the means for a user to subscribe / unsubscribe ( perhaps an option within the notifications dashboard itself )
